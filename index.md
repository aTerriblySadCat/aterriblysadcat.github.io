Hello and welcome to my little Github Pages place.

This is where I post my malware reports for all to see.

The pages are hosted on Github: [https://github.com/aTerriblySadCat/aterriblysadcat.github.io](https://github.com/aTerriblySadCat/aterriblysadcat.github.io)

Every single one has been cat approved, of course.

May your journeys down the rabbit holes made available here be entertaining!

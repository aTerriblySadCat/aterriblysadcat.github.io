# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my little analysis corner!

Here is where I post my malware reports for all to see. Or all who want to see, more like it.

The pages are hosted on Github (obviously): [https://github.com/aTerriblySadCat/aterriblysadcat.github.io](https://github.com/aTerriblySadCat/aterriblysadcat.github.io)

Every single one has been cat approved (again, obviously).

May your journeys down the rabbit holes made available here be entertaining!

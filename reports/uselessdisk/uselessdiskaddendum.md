## 2. Malware analysis setup

Following here is the environment and the tools used to analyze the UselessDisk malware.

<div id="environment"/>

### 2.1. Environment

![NetworkDiagram](./images/Analysis Environment.drawio.png)

All systems, aside from the Host, are virtual machines running on the Host within VirtualBox. Snapshots were taken of the systems before the analysis.

The pfSense firewall has a NAT rule to allow SSH (port 22) traffic from the host via OPT1 to reach the Ubuntu Server that is on the LAN.

The pfSense firewall also has a firewall rule that allows HTTPS (port 443) traffic from the host via OPT1 to reach itself.

The Ubuntu Server has SFTP setup, which is used to bring malware samples into the environment without relying on VirtualBox Guest Additions. Which may be detected by anti-analysis techniques.

The Ubuntu Server also has Zeek and ELK Stack running. For network analysis.

The Windows 10 Pro and Windows 7 Ultimate have the same tools installed.

They are also configured with Windows Update disabled, the Firewall turned off, and Windows Defender turned off as well.

<div id="tools"/>

### 2.2. Tools

For malware analysis, which was done on the Windows 10 Pro and Windows 7 Ultimate machines, the following tools were used:

- Wireshark
- Regshot
- FileActivityWatch
- xDBG
- FolderChangesView
- HxD
- Ghidra
- PEStudio
- CFF Explorer
- ExeInfo PE

<div id="the-process"/>

## 3. The process

Now for the actual analysis process, described in detail with screenshots of important finds.

- For starters, the malware was run on the Windows 7 Ultimate machine, since this was also the machine that first detected the malware in Any.Run, without any tooling running. To test if it worked. 

![BeforeExecution](./images/1 - Before Execution.png)

![AfterExecution](./images/2 - After Execution.png)

- As one can see, the message is shown, and infection is confirmed to work. Nothing else can be done at this point but return the VM to a previous snapshot.


![ZeekLog](./images/3 - A Single Bit Of Traffic Coming From Infected Device.png)

![ZeekLog2](./images/4 - Could Indicate SSDP.png)

![ZeekLog3](./images/5 - UDP also used for SSDP.png)

- Though some network traffic was captured, one packet to be exact, this turned out to be a harmless SSDP call made by the Windows machine. An uninfected machine made the same call. It was just a coincidence.
- After having excluded the involvement of network related functionality it was time to get into the malware itself.


![ExeInfoPe](./images/6 - PE info UselessDisk.png)

- From the ExeInfo PE analysis we can see two interesting things.
    - First, that the target language is Microsoft Visual C++
    - Second, that it has not been packed at all. This especially makes analysis much easier.


![PEStudio](./images/10 - The hash for the executable part of the malware.png)

- Here the hash values for the executable section of the PE can be seen. PEStudio ended up being mostly used for further analysis, with CFF Explorer being left at the wayside.


![PEStudioStrings](./images/11 - An interesting function here DeviceIoControl.png)

- Upon checking the strings found in the PE, some interesting results came by.
    - DeviceIoControl was one that immediately jumped out. It was the only one I had not yet heard of, nor had any idea what it did.
    - So, after a quick search I discovered it is used to send Kernel level messages to devices. A very strange, and interesting function. A prime target.
    - [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol)
- After this discovery I found it comfortable enough to open the malware in Ghidra to see what its guts looked like.
    - Keeping the DeviceIoControl function in mind, of course.


![Ghidra](./images/13 - A pretty interesting function.png)

- Upon opening the malware in Ghidra it was trivial to find the DeviceIoControl function (which was used twice) in the code.
    - From the rest of the code it can also be spotted, particularly the WinExec at the bottom and the WriteFile near the center, that this function was very important to the malware.
- After having spent some time looking up what all the function variables could be I spent some time hunting down their values.
    - Tools were also made to help with this. A tool that allows for guesses at how combined flags were made was created to help simplify this process. This allowed me to discovery that the 0xC flag in CreateFileA was a combined GENERIC_WRITE/GENERIC_READ flag.
    - [https://github.com/aTerriblySadCat/Windows-Flag-Decoder](https://github.com/aTerriblySadCat/Windows-Flag-Decoder)


![GhidraDATLocation](./images/14 - Here we have the mysterious DAT value highlighted, which seems to be the string shown after the lock.png)

- Considering the one non-Win32 function was the most enigmatic, I felt it important to figure out what it did. And that I did.
    - The DAT value being referenced turned out to reference the place in the executable file where the locker message was stored.
    - From this I could deduce that this function most likely loads the second parameter into the first parameter, as the first parameter (local_210) is later used in the WriteFile function.


![GhidraDATFull](./images/15 - And as expected, it is.png)

- A quick sidetrack was made to see if this Bitcoin address did have any transactions to its name. Thankfully it did not.


![BitcoinWallet](./images/16 - No transactions. Seems as though the ransomware was not very succesful.png)

- After this I opened the malware in xDBG32 (run with administrator privileges) to discover how the execution of the malware flows.


![xDBG32](./images/17 - What is written to the physical disk.png)

- Here we see what the malware writes to disk in full. For now, the importance of the 55 AA right after the end of the message was not yet known to me, but eventually it was.
    - The 55 AA is used to end a boot record.


![xDBG32Debug](./images/18 - As can be seen here, this is the data that is written to disk.png)

- Seen here is the reference to the memory location 19FCD4 in the ECX register. This is the memory address pointed at by the local_210 variable.
- Then I let the WriteFile execute and see what changed on the system.


![FileActivityWatch](./images/19 - The five bytes are written directly to the hard disk, but nothing else happens.png)

- This was also the point where I became quite sure that the malware did not encrypt any files.
    - The only writes performed by the malware seemed to happen in the money function, and it only writes 512 bytes to PHYSICALDISK0.


![PythonDataCheck](./images/20 - What is written to the physical drive 0 at the first 512 bytes once infecte.png)

- I then used a very quick Python script to check if what the malware claimed to write was indeed written onto the disk. Which it was.


![ProcessHacker](./images/22 - ProcessHacker handles shows the handle to the PhysicalDrive0.png)

- And to confirm again, we can see that a handle to the PHYSICALDISK0 is active. And no other files, aside from itself.


![FolderChangesView](./images/23 - Also a complete and utter lack of interesting changes made by the program (none by the UselessDisk program itself).png)

- And here we can again see that UselessDisk does almost nothing. It does not change any file on the system in any way.


![BitcoinAddressStrings](./images/25 - Interesting, there are two places where the bitcoin address can be found.png)

- Using a tool that I created to quickly find strings in large files (11GB in this case) I discovered that the Bitcoin address associated with the malware was found twice instead of the expected once.
    - The reason for this would later turn out to be that one is the boot record entry, and the other is the string in the executable on the disk.
    - I used the tool on the host, where I had full access to the VM hard disk file.
    - [https://github.com/aTerriblySadCat/String-Extractor](https://github.com/aTerriblySadCat/String-Extractor)
- Upon realizing how the malware operated, not actually encrypting files I theorized that it should be possible to unlock the system.
    - For this reason, I created a tool that allowed me to read and write bytes to specific parts in a file.
    - I used this to analyze the way boot records operate and what a proper boot record should look like.
    - I then overwrote the 512 bytes of malicious boot record with a valid one and started the machine up again.
    - It worked like a charm.
    - Though untested on a physical hard disk, it should work the same since nothing else is touched by the malware. Just the 512 bytes on PHYSICALDRIVE0.
    - [https://github.com/aTerriblySadCat/Byte-Reader](https://github.com/aTerriblySadCat/Byte-Reader)
    - [https://github.com/aTerriblySadCat/Byte-Writer](https://github.com/aTerriblySadCat/Byte-Writer)
- After having figured out what the malware does in general terms and having found a cure for the infection, I decided to take a closer at the one function I did not figure out quite yet. The one non-Win32 function.


![FUN_004012e0](./images/29 - FUN_004012e0.png)

- Seen here is only a small part of the function. It is a massive web of IF, ELSE, and SWITCH statements.
    - However, when the malware runs as intended it simply runs a FOR loop that fills the address at param_1 with the contents found at the address of param_2, for the length of param_3 shifted right by 2.
    - So, to put things simply, it basically just copies one array into another array.


![ForLoop](./images/30 - The for statement the param3 is used in.png)

- Within Ghidra it is also shown that this FOR loop is an assembly OP referred to as MOVSD.REP
    - The REP part refers to the fact that it is repeating.
    - The MOVSD part refers to the moving of data from one register to another. A doubleword, to be exact, which is 2 bytes.
    - It also happens that UTF-16 encoded characters are 2 bytes in size. Therefore, this may be an indication that the characters are UTF-16 encoded.
- Upon some further investigation, it seems memcpy is VERY like the FUN function.
    - [https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/memcpy/](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/memcpy/)
- It seems they do not compile the same, however, something similar to how the FOR loop works is done with memcpy, so it or something similar may convert to it.
    - It is for these reasons that I don’t think the mystery function is some custom, dynamic boot record generator.
    - It is probably either a custom function as memcpy (perhaps so there’re less dependencies needed), a variant of memcpy, or a much older version of memcpy.
